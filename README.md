# PressureDrop
Python script for pressure drop calculations for crossflow tube bundles for both inline and staggered configurations

Author: Jonah Haefner
Contributing and previous work done by: Julien Clayton and Lane Carasik

Inputs:
- a = dimensionless transverse pitch
- b = dimensionless longitudinal pitch
- v = the free stream fluid velocity in m/s 
- rho = density in g/cm^3
- u = dynamic viscosity in pa*s
- N = number of rows in the tube bundle 
- Dtube = The diamter of the tubes in the bundle in m

Outputs:
- Pressure Drop in kPa

Limitations:
- Will work for values of b = 1.25, 1.5, or 2
- Reynolds number needs to be below 150000
