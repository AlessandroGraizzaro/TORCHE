# PressureDrop
Python Script. Pressure drop calculations for crossflow tube bundles. Based of work by Zukauskas

Author: Jonah Haefner
Contributing and previous work done by: Julien Clayton and Lane Carasik

Units
a = dimensionless transverse pitch

b = dimensionless longitudinal pitch

v = the free stream fluid velocity in m/s 

rho = density in g/cm^3

u = dynamic viscosity in pa*s

N = number of rows in the tube bundle 

Dtube = The diamter of the tubes in the bundle in m

Will work for values of b = 1.25, 1.5, or 2

Reynolds number needs to be below 150000

 Output Pressure Drop in kPa
